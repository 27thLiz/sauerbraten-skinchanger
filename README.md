# sauerbraten-skinchanger

Script to change the skins of sauerbraten playermodels on the fly.
Currently only supports snout. If anyone has nice colored skins for Inky/Fixit/Cpt feel free to ping me.

Inspired and made possible by the awesome work of Salatiel and his [Skin-Colorizer](https://github.com/SalatielSauer/Sauer-Skin-Colorizer).

* Extract to `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Sauerbraten` (windows)
